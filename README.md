# Huffman
Huffman compression / CS 241: Data Struc. and Alg II

Winter 2015

Implemented a Huffman encoding to compress a series of files.

Lessons learned:
* Huffman encoding is a lossless form of compression
* Letters in file are made up of a series of bits that represent characters.
* Encoding process: to represent the most recurring characters with a smaller series of bits.
* Such compression retains same information using a smaller space on average.
* Using a key it's possible to switch between compressed and original version without losing any data.
